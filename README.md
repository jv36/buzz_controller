Player 1: {'big': '1', 'blue': 'q', 'orange': 'w', 'green': 'e', 'yellow': 'r'}

Player 2: {'big': '2', 'blue': 'a', 'orange': 's', 'green': 'd', 'yellow': 'f'}

Player 3: {'big': '3', 'blue': 'z', 'orange': 'x', 'green': 'c', 'yellow': 'v'}

Player 4: {'big': '4', 'blue': 'u', 'orange': 'i', 'green': 'o', 'yellow': 'p'}

werbserver runs on port 80 so you can directly open http://yourip/ 

if you have to change this you have to edit buzz_controller.py at the bottom (2 places for change the port)
